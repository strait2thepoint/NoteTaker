# Note Taker
This app is a note taker where you can add and delete notes

## Description
- What was your motivation?
I was interested in better understanding back end web development.  This project was a good way to work through that process.
 
- What problem does it solve?
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
(from MSU BCS User Story)

- What did you learn?
I learned how to require dependencies, use GET & POST and how to specify the port.  Also, I learned how to utilize chatGPT as a tool to better understand the code that I was writing. I asked it to explain the code to me and its functionality, then placed the descriptions in the code so other students can better understand their assignments.  Please note, the green comments are from chatGPT.
